The Periodic Table of Elements is a scientific chart that organizes all known chemical
elements according to their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties.
It was first developed by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.
The table is arranged in rows called periods and columns called groups.
Elements in the same group share similar chemical behaviors, such as reactivity or bonding style.
For example, noble gases like helium, neon, and argon are stable and unreactive, while alkali metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium are highly reactive. 
The periodic table is one of the most important tools in chemistry because it helps scientists predict the properties of elements and their compounds.
